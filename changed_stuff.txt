(if you're looking through this repo, dont worry about this)
changed:

urls for maven google and cloud google. originals: maven.google.com and cloud.google.com
environment variables within project itself (2 of them), pu_dev and storage_flutter or something (go to the flutter china page)
your_project/android/app/build.gradle ---> changed compile sdk ver and target sdk ver

for next project, everything should be fine...
